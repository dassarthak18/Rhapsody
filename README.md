# Rhapsody
A C++ library for modelling, simulation, and verification of multi-agent hybrid systems.

**TODO**: Implement a 2-agent ACC benchmark. In order to do so, need to create a Scenario object and put the simulate function there. Start off with the BaseSensor variant, that is, all agents can see and modify all variables of other agents.
