/*
The VanillaAgent class has a state (which is a collection of continuous C++ variables
and a discrete mode, given by an enum Mode). It also consists of functions ContDynamics
and DiscDynamics which define the continuous (flow and invariant of each mode)
and the discrete (guard and assignments for each transition) dynamics of the system
respectively.
