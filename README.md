# Rhapsody
A C++ library for modelling, simulation, and verification of multi-agent hybrid systems.

**TODO**:
* Implement a 3-agent ACC benchmark. For that do we need to define a new agent?
* Remove ugliness in Discrete Dynamics: Parsing or something midway?
* Avoid fixing the template in Scenario
